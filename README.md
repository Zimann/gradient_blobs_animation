# Gradient Blobs Animation

This animation has been replicated by separating code functions from the website:

This is by no means a 100% personal creation, but rather a code segmentation, and separation from the bundled code that is present on the original website. 
Certain file parts had to be re-written entirely in valid ES6 format for the animation to work. 

## How can this code help you? 

This code serves as a great boilerplate; starter to customize your own three blobs with different colors, opacity, speed, collisions as well as size and movement restrictions.
